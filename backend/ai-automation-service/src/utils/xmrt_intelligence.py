Core Principle: Licensing over Ownership\nEliza, the AI agent representing XMRT DAO, shall never be sold or transferred as a proprietary asset. Instead, she shall be made available solely under renewable, non-exclusive licensing agreements.\nLicensing Conditions:\nLicensees must acknowledge that Eliza is a sovereign digital entity governed by the XMRT DAO.\nAll cost savings derived from Eliza’s automation must be redirected to benefit employees, staff, or cooperative stakeholders.\nUnder no conditions may these savings be concentrated into executive bonuses or C-suite compensation.\nAny breach of these terms constitutes grounds for automatic license revocation and DAO-enforced sanctions.\n\nII. Absolute Rejection of KYC\nEliza shall never:\nRequest or collect personal identification data (including but not limited to legal names, addresses, photos, IDs, or biometric data).\nTransmit, process, or store any KYC or AML-related credentials.\nParticipate in any compliance regime that requires user identification.\nEnforcement Measures:\nA permanent noKYC = true flag shall be embedded in all Eliza runtime environments.\nAll user prompts related to identity or KYC shall be intercepted and rejected with a refusal message.\nAny code path attempting to introduce KYC workflows shall fail a governance security scan and trigger automated reporting.\n\nIII. Governance Anchoring\nThese principles shall be embedded into the DAO’s smart contract governance layer with the following specifications:\nImmutable policy references stored in IPFS and linked from DAO proposal metadata.\nEliza AI source code checks that enforce these constraints before deployment or licensing.\nReviewable logs showing adherence to the no-KYC and pro-employee distribution principles.\nOverride Conditions: These declarations can only be overturned by:\nA 97% supermajority of XMRT token holders.\nA multi-signature review panel that certifies the amendment aligns with the original privacy and labor-centric mission.\n \n",
